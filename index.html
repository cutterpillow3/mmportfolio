                <p>Hi, I'm Mau! I'm currently juggling life as a CompSci student at UPOU, a corporate employee in Ortigas, and a proud Persian cat parent. For the past couple of years, my main focus has been on my career, studies, and healthy lifestyle. It's a work in progress, but I'm committed to these goals. My long-term plans are to create a positive environment for myself and invest in things that truly matter.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Travel ‚úàÔ∏è</h3>
                <p> I like to travel, but I don't go overboard. I prefer to travel when I've finished my work and have time off. I'm not a fan of unplanned trips, but I'll admit I'm not the most organized either. I try to find a balance between being spontaneous and planning ahead. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Eat ü•ò</h3>
                <p> I love dining out to de-stress! I wouldn't call it a real hobby since I also like home cooked meals. But eating a good food at a restaurant, especially when it's worth the price, is just an amazing experience for me once in a while. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h3>
                <p>Last but not the least, the new found hobby of almost everyone I know, running. What I like about running is its simplicity. I only need to focus on three elements - breathing, mindset and posture and I'm all set. I'm not breaking any records yet, but I definitely enjoy the slow progress. </p>
